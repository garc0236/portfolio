# portfolio

Well at first , it wasn't easy to create even this part of my portfolio, you need to put all pieces that you have learnt through the term together. And is not easy when you have to joggling between other subjects, because when you are finally in position to start to do this project, your mind is completely full of another information. So is even harder try to recall all lessons. You gotta go back and refresh concepts.

The challenges that I encountered doing this work were; trying to recall information, put all pieces of the puzzle together, I found that I still have some problems with flex, grid, and other basic concepts...so it was time consuming trying to go back to see again and again lessons and information..is frustating also because I just could do the mobile layout almost perfect...but there are 2 pages more of my prototype that are missing.

I think I learnt perfectly how to make resizing images, animations, and some accesibility things in this term, but during break time I hope to reinforce what maybe I did wrong, complete my piece of portfolio and improve my web dev skills.
